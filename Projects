Algorithms

Give the runtime in big-O notation in terms of n for the following piece of code/algorithm: for i in range(0, n): do_something(i)

Below are common algorithmic questions.

Autocomplete: string[] GetSuggestions(string[] corpus, string prefix)
Given some corpus of words (eg. ['cat','carrot','dog',...]). 
Give a function that gives an array of suggestions based on the prefix. 
For example, 'ca' would give cat and carrot.

Flattened Files: string[] GetAllFiles(string[] paths, string rootPath)
Given some array of file.
Give a function that returns all paths with the given root path.

Odd Number Tester: bool IsOdd(int n)
Give a function that returns true if the number is odd and false if even.

Fizz Buzz: void FizzBuzz(int n)
Classic interview questions.
Give a function that prints "fizz" if divisible by 3, "buzz" if divisible by 5 and "fizz buzz" if divisible by both.

Fibonacci Numbers: int GetFibonacciNumber(int n)
Give a function that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number.

Conway Sequence: string[] GetConwaySequence(int n)
Give a function that calculates the n-th Conway sequence number.
Look it up on Wikipedia. Matters less that you know what this integer sequence is and more that you know the steps to provide a solution.

Primes: int[] GetPrimes(int n)
Give a function to give a list of primes up to the n-th.
Can be solved using various methods.

Random Number: int GetRandom(int seed)
Give a random function.
Requires understanding how randomness works and what entropy means (you understand this from your Thermodynamics courses). 
No machine computation is actually random but rather pseudo-random. 
Knowing how this works is important (ie. seeding) and touching everything from security to web traffic.

Hash Code: int GetHashCode(int[] fieldValues)
Give a function to calculate a hash based on several integer values.
Requires understanding how hashes work and why they are awesome.

Roman Numeral Converter: int GetIntegerValue(string value)
Give a function to convert a Roman numeral to a base-10 integer.
Tests your problem solving skills more than anything.

Scripting / RegEx: valid US phone #
You should learn regular expressions eventually but can skip this for now.

Whitespace Trim: string Trim(string value)
Give a function that trims the whitespace of the value at both ends ("       hell  oooo    " should be "hell oooo").

Anagrams: string[] GetAnagrams(string[] words, char[] letters)
Give a function that finds all anagrams given a corpus of words and the letters in the anagram.
